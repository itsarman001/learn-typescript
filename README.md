# Learn TypeScript

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! This repository is a collection of exercises, examples, and organized notes as I learn TypeScript. The goal is to practice TypeScript's various features and keep track of my learning progress.

## Installation

To get started with this repository on your local machine, you'll need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. Once you have that, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsarman001/learn-typescript.git
   cd learn-typescript
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript:
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```

4. Start working through the exercises or try running the code in the `dist` folder:
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```

## Usage

The main purpose of this repository is to help me practice TypeScript. As I work through various examples and tutorials, I'll be adding files and notes to this repository. Feel free to explore, experiment with the examples, and modify the code.

If you'd like to use this repository to learn along with me, follow the steps in the **Installation** section and start experimenting with the files in the `src` directory.

## File Structure

Here's an overview of the directory structure:

```
typescript-learning/
├── README.md            # Project overview and documentation
├── package.json         # NPM dependencies (e.g., TypeScript)
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration file
├── .gitignore           # Git ignore file
├── notes/               # Folder for organizing learning notes by topic
│   ├── basic-types.md   # Notes on basic types in TypeScript
│   ├── interfaces.md    # Notes on interfaces in TypeScript
│   ├── generics.md      # Notes on generics in TypeScript
│   ├── async-await.md   # Notes on async/await in TypeScript
│   └── ...              # Other notes files organized by topic
├── src/
│   ├── examples/        # Example files for basic TypeScript concepts
│   ├── advanced/        # Advanced TypeScript features (generics, decorators, etc.)
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   └── index.ts         # Main entry point for the application
├── dist/                # Compiled JavaScript files (generated by TypeScript)
└── node_modules/        # Installed npm packages
```

### Directory Breakdown:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for various TypeScript examples.
  - **`examples/`**: Basic examples to learn and practice concepts like types, interfaces, functions, and classes.
  - **`advanced/`**: More advanced topics like generics, decorators, async/await, and modules.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions to be used across different files.
  - **`index.ts`**: Main entry point for running TypeScript code.
  
- **`dist/`**: This folder contains the compiled JavaScript files after running the TypeScript compiler.

- **`notes/`**: This folder contains organized notes on various TypeScript topics. Each topic has its own `.md` file. For example:
  - `basic-types.md` (Notes on TypeScript’s basic types)
  - `interfaces.md` (Notes on interfaces in TypeScript)
  - `generics.md` (Notes on generics in TypeScript)
  - `async-await.md` (Notes on using async/await in TypeScript)

  You can add a new `.md` file for each topic you study or encounter.

## Learning Notes

As I progress through my learning, I’ll be storing notes on different TypeScript topics in the `notes/` folder. Each note is organized by topic and can be accessed by the following links:

- [Basic Types](notes/basic-types.md)
- [Interfaces](notes/interfaces.md)
- [Generics](notes/generics.md)
- [Async/Await](notes/async-await.md)

Feel free to explore and add your own notes as you learn.
